📝 **Live Game of Life**

A fun and interactive implementation of the "Game of Life" built with plain JavaScript and styled with a beautiful neumorphism-inspired design. The game allows you to create cells, start/stop/reset the game, and watch the grid evolve in your browser — no dependencies required.

🌟 **Features**
- 🆕 Create cells by clicking on the grid
- ✅ Start the game and watch the cells evolve according to Conway's Game of Life rules
- ❌ Stop the game
- 🔄 Reset the grid to its initial state
- 🧩 Neumorphism-inspired design
- 💾 Automatically saves game state while playing (using JavaScript)

🖼️ **Interface**
DOM elements used in the app:
- `.gameCanvas` — canvas element to render the grid and game state
- `.startGame` — button to start the game
- `.stopGame` — button to stop the game
- `.resetGame` — button to reset the game
